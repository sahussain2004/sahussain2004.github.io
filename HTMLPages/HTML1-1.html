        <p>When you view a web page in your browser, you are seeing the interpreted code that you type into your text editor. Web pages are made up of text which is called "Marked Up", or formatted using Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML. The HTML codes, known as tags, are placed around the text that you want to format. In most cases, when formatting text, you will have both an opening and closing tag to indicate where the formatting should start and where it should end.</p>
        <p>Content on a web page is contained inside elements. There are basically two types of elements, block and inline. This content is being written inside a paragraph element, which is a block element because there will be space above and below the paragraph essentially blocking it off from other content.<strong> However this content is in a strong element which is inline. Inline elements do not seperate their content.</strong> Block elements will effect a pages layout, where inline elements will not.</p>
        <p>There are all different types of elements that go to make up a web page. The elements used on this page is the HTML, which is also called the root element, the head element, body element, heading element, paragraph element, and the strong inline element. The elements used on this page, other than the strong element, are the minimum that any web page should include. In the next lab you will include some of the other elements used to organize content on a web page.</p>
